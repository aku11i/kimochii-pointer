## General usage

Initialize in your entry point:

```typescript

const pointer = new KimochiiPointer();

pointer.mount(); // Pointer will be shown to the display.
```

Set a shape name to custom attribute `data-kimochii-pointer` of HTML element you want to change the shape of pointer.

e.g.:

```html
<button data-kimochii-pointer="sticky">BUTTON</button>
```

Pointer will be sticked to the element when you move to over the one.

```css
* {
  cursor: none !important;
}
```

// Create a custom shape.
class PinkShape implements Shape {
  name: Shape["name"] = "pink";

  private _pointer: Pointer;

  private _backup: Required<Pick<gsap.TweenVars, "backgroundColor">>;

  constructor(pointer: Pointer) {
    this._pointer = pointer;
    this._backup = {
      // Backup default pointer color to restore.
      backgroundColor: this._pointer.getProperty("backgroundColor"),
    };
  }

  transform: Shape["transform"] = () => {
    this._pointer.apply({ backgroundColor: "hotpink" });
  };

  restore: Shape["restore"] = () => {
    this._pointer.apply({ ...this._backup });
  };
}
```
