## General usage

Initialize in your entry point:

```typescript
import { KimochiiPointer } from "kimochii-pointer";

const pointer = new KimochiiPointer();

pointer.mount(); // Pointer will be shown to the display.
```

Set a shape name to custom attribute `data-kimochii-pointer` of HTML element you want to change the shape of pointer.

e.g.:

```html
<button data-kimochii-pointer="sticky">BUTTON</button>
```

Pointer will be sticked to the element when you move to over the one.

If you want to hide default mouse cursor of operation system, add below style to your global css:

```css
* {
  cursor: none !important;
}
```

There are preinstalled shapes.

You can use them without any steps.

```

```

## Create a custom shape

`ShapeFactory` is usefull function type to create a custom shape.

Below is an example of custom shape that change pointer color to pink.

```typescript
import { ShapeFactory } from "kimochii-pointer";

export const pinkShapeFactory: ShapeFactory = (pointer) => {
  // Backup default pointer color.
  const backgroundColor = pointer.getProperty("backgroundColor");

  return {
    name: "pink",

    transform: () => {
      pointer.apply({ backgroundColor: "hotpink" });
    },

    restore: () => {
      pointer.apply({ backgroundColor });
    },
  };
};
```

Register to the pointer:

```typescript
import { KimochiiPointer, Shape } from "kimochii-pointer";
import { pinkShapeFactory } from "./pinkShape";

const pointer = new KimochiiPointer();
pointer.mount();

const pinkShape = pinkShapeFactory(pointer);
